            <div class="c1">
                <strong>Incremental backup </strong>is a method of backing up data where only the changes made since the last backup are stored. This approach helps reduce storage space and backup time compared to full backups, which involve copying all data each time.
                Unlike full backups which copy everything, incremental backups focus solely on changes since the last backup. It's like keeping a running log of modifications, ensuring you capture the latest revisions without replicating data already preserved.
                <p class="c1"><strong>Flutter</strong> is a powerful and popular open-source UI framework for building beautiful, native-looking mobile, web, desktop, and embedded applications from a single codebase.

        <h2>Service-based project on IOT</h2>
        <div class="f7">
            <div class="c1">
                The advent of the <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> has brought about transformative changes in various sectors, and agriculture is no exception. 
                The integration of IoT technologies in agriculture, commonly known as IoT-enabled agriculture or smart agriculture, has revolutionized traditional farming practices by enabling real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, and automation. 
                This abstract provides insights into IoT-enabled agriculture, highlighting its potential benefits, key applications, challenges, and future prospects.
                <p class="c1">IoT-enabled agriculture leverages a network of interconnected devices, sensors, actuators, and data analytics to enhance productivity, sustainability, and efficiency in farming practices. 
                    By deploying various IoT sensors and devices, farmers can monitor crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and plant health remotely and in real-time. This real-time monitoring allows for precise irrigation, optimized resource management, and early detection of crop diseases, ultimately leading to higher yields and reduced environmental impact.</p>
                <p class="c1">One of the key applications of IoT in agriculture is precision farming. By utilizing IoT sensors and GPS technology, farmers can create detailed maps of their fields, monitor crop growth patterns, and apply fertilizers or pesticides with precision. This targeted approach minimizes resource wastage and reduces the negative impact on the ecosystem.
